## About

Hello. My name's Michelle and I currently work as a Lead AI scientist at Target.

I joined Target in the Fall of 2020, soon after completing my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota, MN.
My thesis focused on proving weighted quasimap wallcrossing formulas via localization. Quasimap theory was developed by
my advisor, Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine, and his collaborators and belongs to the broader area of Algebraic Geometry.
When people ask me why others and I care about this topic, the best answer I can usually come up with, apart from the
not-so-well-received "because it's beautiful and freaking cool", is that is has relations to string theory.

These days I think less about quasimaps and more about how to make computers do tasks humans are very good at, but are so boring
and menial, that they are better off doing something else. That being said, I also believe that this should always be done with 
privacy and (algorithmic) fairness in mind, so these research areas are also of great interest to me.

The tools I use vary from the simplest linear model to the latest deep neural networks, depending on the task. I love what I do
because it combines two of my biggest passions: I can use my background in mathematics to figure out which tool to use and why,
but then I can also spend a good chunk of time coding up the solution.
