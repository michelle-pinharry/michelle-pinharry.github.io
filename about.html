## About

Hello. My name's Michelle and I currently work as a Lead AI scientist at Target.

I joined Target in the Fall of 2020,  soon after completing my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota.
My thesis was on weighted quasimap wallcrossings, a subject focus which sits in the broader subject area of Algebraic Geometry.
When people ask me why others and I care about this, the best answer I can usually come up with, apart from the not so well-received
"because it's beautiful and freaking cool", is that is has relations to string theory.

These days I think less about quasimaps and more about how to make computers do tasks humans are very good at but are so boring and menial,
that they are much better off doing something else. The tools I use vary from the simplest linear model to large, complicated, deep neural networks,
depending on the task. Some of my favourite parts of the job are figuring out which tool to use and why, and then spending a good chunk of time
coding up the solution.
