## About

Hello. My name's Michelle and I currently work as a Lead AI scientist at Target.

I joined Target in the Fall of 2020,  soon after completing my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota.
My thesis was on weighted quasimap wallcrossings, a subject focus which sits in the broader subject area of Algebraic Geometry.
When people ask me to explain why people care about this, the best I can usually do is to say that it has relations to string theory.

These days I think less about quasimaps and more about how to make computers do tasks humans are very good at but are so boring and menial,
that they are much better off doing something else.
